# Mines
A curel minesweeping game: you can guess anywhere if no block is not mine for sure, but booms if there is a block that is certainly not mine.

This little game is base on VS and [EasyX](https://easyx.cn/).

This is no proof my solver is correct, start the game with ```--debug --seed=X``` or ```--debug --replay=XXX.log``` to debug.
